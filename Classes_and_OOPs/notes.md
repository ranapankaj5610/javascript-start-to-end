## 4 pillars
Abstraction //To hide the data from user
Encapsulation //To wrap the data in a block
Inheritance //To use the properties and the method of the parent
Polymorphism //Use of one method for many ways.

## Inheritence
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.
